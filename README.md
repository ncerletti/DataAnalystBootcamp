# DataAnalystBootcamp

Here you will find the files corresponding to my journey with the Data Analyst Bootcamp provided by Alex the Analyst on Youtube (link: https://bit.ly/3HHqwcr)

The main focus of this course is to learn different tools as used by Data Analysts in their daily work life, including: SQL, Excel, Python and Pandas, PowerBi and Tableau.
